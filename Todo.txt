Very tight schedule (2years 2027) but if it takes a bit more or a lot more|||
create load ini function: I think already exists.
and a patch ini function: that saves respecting exisiting spacing, formatting, and put new keys at end. This is merge mode. 
( for now won't delete non existing keys in the patch, what would be sync mode that could optionally just mark deleted keys
with # and # (comment) deleted on <date> (by <user>)?).
Todo put at least four fields at netnode_desktop options form:
domain  IPv4 address
<domain>=<ip_address>

domain  IPv6 address
<domain>=<ip_address>

and show path where <domain>.cat is expected to be (full certificat with private key).
